AI-Powered Threat Modeling Project 🚀🔐

🔹 I Built This to Test My Development Skills Again After Many Years!

After a long break from hands-on development, I challenged myself to build a Threat Modeling Tool powered by Generative AI (OpenAI’s GPT-4o). This project was a great way to refresh my coding skills while integrating cutting-edge AI into cybersecurity threat analysis.

🛠 What This Tool Does

✅ Automates Threat Analysis – Identifies security risks in system architectures
✅ Leverages AI for Mitigation Strategies – Uses OpenAI to suggest security improvements
✅ Enhances Security Workflows – Helps teams model and analyze threats efficiently

⚡ Why I Built This

I wanted to push myself technically, revisit hands-on development, and experiment with AI’s role in modern cybersecurity. This project serves as both a learning experience and a useful tool for security teams.

Would love to hear your feedback! 🚀 Let me know what you think and how this can be improved further. #CyberSecurity #AI #ThreatModeling #Development #OpenSource
